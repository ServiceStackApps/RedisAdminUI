# [Introducing Redis React](https://servicestack.net/redis-react)

Redis React is a simple user-friendly UI for browsing data in Redis servers that leverages the navigation and deep-linking 
benefits of a Web-based UI, the productivity and responsiveness of the [React framework](http://facebook.github.io/react/) 
and the deep Integration possible from a Native App.

### [Live Demo](http://redisreact.servicestack.net/#/)

The Redis React App has been packaged for multiple platforms inc. the ASP.NET Live Demo 
[redisreact.servicestack.net](http://redisreact.servicestack.net/#/) deployed on AWS which you can use to preview Redis React browsing a redis server populated with the 
[Northwind Dataset](http://northwind.servicestack.net/) persisted as JSON following the
[Complex Type Conventions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8919931/85785) built into the 
[C# ServiceStack.Redis Client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis).
